   <li> All Purpose Flour! two 1/2 cups!! </li>

   <li> Brown Sugar 🤎 3/4 make sure its fresh!! </li>

   <li> White Sugar 🤍 !! You will need 1/4 or 1/2 cups of granulated sugar to add the rest of the sweetness to the cookies.</li>

   <li> Eggs!🥚 one to two large eggs! and extra yolk if needed!  </li>

   <li> Vanilla Extract!! i'd recommend 2 teaspoons but!! The higher the quality of the Vanilla, the better!!</li>
  
   <li> Salt ✨🧂 Just a little bit of salt helps to bring out all of the other flavors in the cookies i recommend 1/2 teaspoon ✨.</li>

   <li> Nutella!! you will need a total of 3/4 cups!! </li>
  
   <p>  (Disclaimer❕If you want your cookies to be fluffier i recommend 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda!! Backing soda acts as the leavening agent in the cookie) 🍪😋 </p>

   

</ul>

  <h3> 🎂 Step Times ✨</h3>
  <ol> 
  <li> Turn on your favorite baking playlist 🎶 your about to make magic! ✨ </li>

<li> ‼️WAIT‼️ Before you start, Grab a small tray and line it with parchment paper. Now take your jar of Nutella (aka the good stuff 😋) and use a ice cream to scoop out little nutella circle blobs!! Then drop them onto the tray. Pop that tray in the freezer for about 45 to 1 hour until those blobs are firm and a little forzen 🥶❄️❕ </li>

<li> Now lets start ( For the Cookie Dough!!) In one bowl, whisk together flour,(if you want, add baking soda now!!) salt🧂 </li>

<li> Boring but most important part! In another bowl (the main stage),Mix your melted butter 🧈, brown sugar 🧸 and granulated sugar 🧁, UNTIL ITS SMOOTH AND GLOSSY 🫧🎂. Add one to two eggs 🥚, extra yolk and your fav vanilla extract! 🍦 Then whisk again until everything's beautifully blended 🧑‍🍳 </li>

<li> Now slowly add your dry ingredients into the wet mix!! Stiring until a soft dough forms 🥐 Finally, fold in your chocolate chips (as many as you want) 🍪🍫 </li>

<li> 🙌 BONUS 👩‍🍳 If you want extra nutella flavor, swirl 2 to 3 tablespoons of Nutella directly into the dough at this stage for that yummy 😋 double chocolate chaos🍫 </li>
 
<li> Now you can finally chill! 🧊❕Cover your dough and pop it in the fridge for 45minutes to 1hour (This is the secret to keep your cookies, thick, chewy and bakery level good!! ) </li>

<li> Now.. Operation Stuffed Cookie!! 🍪👩‍🍳🧈
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) Line a baking with parchment paper. Now take out your cookie dough 🍪 from the fridge and scoop a ball of the dough (about 2 tablespoons), flatten it slightly, and place one frozen Nutella ball in the center. Then wrap the dough around it like a cozy blanket no Nutella should be peeking out 👀 . Place each stuffed cookie on the tray, leaving space!! </li>

<li> 🎂 BAKE OF GLORY 🧑‍🍳🧁⏲️ One of the last steps... Put the tray in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, Just until the edges are VERRY Golden 💛 but the centers still look soft... NOW LET THEM COOL FOR 5 TO 10 MINUTES 🧁⏲️ !! ( YES I KNOW ITS TORTURE 😩 ) Then let them cool then transfer to a rack or plates 😋🍽️  </li>

<li> ‼️WAIT‼️ While there still warm, Sprinke Flaky Sea Salt TO MAKE IT EXTRA FANCY 👑🍾🥂💸 </li>

<li> 👩‍🍳🍪!! FINAL PART!! 👩‍🍳🍪 
  THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!!! ALL YOUR WORK FINALLY PAID OFF!! I HOPE YOU LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I LOVED MAKING IT WITH YOU!!!
